# Zorn's Lemma

An existence theorem asserts the existence of an object belonging to a certain set and possessing certain properties. Many existence theorems can be formulated (or, if need be, reformulated) so that the underlying set is a partially ordered set and the crucial property is maximality. Our next purpose is to state and prove the most important theorem of this kind.

If $X$ is a partially ordered set such that every chain in $X$ has an upper bound, then $X$ contains a maximal element.
